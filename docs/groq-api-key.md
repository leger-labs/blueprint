To get a Groq API key, follow these steps:

Create an account or log in to your Groq account at https://console.groq.com/login.

Navigate to the "API Keys" section in the Groq Cloud console.

Click on "Create API Key."

Enter a display name for the API key (something descriptive to identify it later).

Submit the form to generate the API key.

Copy the API key immediately and store it securely, as you won't be able to see it again after leaving the page.

For security, it is recommended to set your API key as an environment variable (e.g., export GROQ_API_KEY=<your-api-key>) to avoid exposing it in code.
