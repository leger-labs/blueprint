How to Obtain an OpenRouter API Key
To interact with the OpenRouter API, you need an API key tied to your account. Follow these steps to register, generate, and manage your key:

1. Create or Log In to Your OpenRouter Account
Navigate to https://openrouter.ai in your browser.

Click Sign Up (if you don’t have an account) or Log In (if you already registered).

Complete the signup form (email address, password) or authenticate via OAuth if supported.

Verify your email address by clicking the link sent to your inbox.

2. Access the API Dashboard
After logging in, click your user avatar or name in the top-right corner.

Select API Keys or Dashboard from the dropdown menu.

3. Generate a New API Key
In the API Keys section, click the + Create New Key button.

Give your key a descriptive name (for example, “home-server-integration”).

(Optional) Set usage limits or scopes if OpenRouter offers granular permissions.

Click Generate.

A new API key string will appear. Copy it immediately—for security reasons it may only be shown once.
