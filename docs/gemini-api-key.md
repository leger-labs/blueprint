To create a Google Gemini API key, follow these steps:
https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart

Sign in to Google AI Studio using your Google account.

Create or import a Google Cloud project into Google AI Studio. If you don't have one, create a new Google Cloud project.

In Google AI Studio, go to the Dashboard menu and open the API Keys page.

Create a new API key in your imported or newly created project.

Copy the generated API key and keep it secure, as it is used to authenticate your API requests.

You can then use this key in your development environment by setting it as an environment variable named GEMINI_API_KEY or by passing it directly in your code when initializing the Gemini API client.
